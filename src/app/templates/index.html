        <p>NeuralTag is an application that automatically names your activities using your past naming conventions as well as some creativity</p>
        <h1>How does it work:</h1>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <ul style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
            <li>Start by connecting your Strava account - leave the permissions as is in order to allow the app to work correctly</li>
            <li>Create a new activity with strava</li>
            <li>After your activity is saved, NeuralTag will automatically name your activity and append "named with NeuralTag ðŸ¤–" to the description</li>
            <li>NeuralTag will learn from your naming conventions and improve over time</li>
            <li>If you don't like the name you can set your activity to Rename and NeuralTag will try again</li>
            <li>If you still don't like the name you can just change it</li>
            <li>If you don't want NeuralTag to rename your activites anymore you can opt out by navigating to <a href="https://www.strava.com/settings/apps">My Apps</a> and select revoke access for <b>Neuraltag</b></li>
            </ul>
