def update_weight_training_activity_names(days, token_dict):
    """Updates the names of weight training activities on Strava based on the day of the week.

    Args:
        days (int): The number of days back to check for activities.
        token_dict (dict): A dictionary containing the Strava API access token, refresh token, and expiration time.
            The dictionary should have the following keys:
                - "access_token" (str): The Strava API access token.
                - "refresh_token" (str): The Strava API refresh token.
                - "expires_at" (int): The expiration time of the access token as a Unix timestamp.

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return any value. It updates the activity names directly on Strava
              and sends push notifications via Pushbullet.

    Raises:
        Exception: If there are issues connecting to the Strava API or Pushbullet.

    Details:
        The function retrieves weight training activities from Strava within the specified number of days.
        It infers a new name for each activity based on the day of the week the activity occurred:
            - Monday/Tuesday: "Pull day"
            - Wednesday/Thursday: "Leg day"
            - Friday/Saturday: "Push day ðŸ’ª"
            - Sunday: "Unknown"
        It then updates the activity name on Strava and sends a push notification using Pushbullet
        to confirm the update.  It only updates activities whose names contain "Weight Training".
